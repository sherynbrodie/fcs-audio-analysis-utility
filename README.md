### R script to aid navigation of long-duration environmental recordings and selection of audio segments using false-colour spectrograms.

This repository contains R code to open and view false-colour spectrograms (FCS) to navigate sound recordings, and allow interactive selection and opening of short segments of audio for manual analysis.  

Two R files are included:  
1. R script for set up and calling the interactive selection functions.
2. R file containing the accompanying user-defined functions.  

The R script was intended to be run using R Studio, for repeated calls to the selection functions, and interactive selection on the FCS images using mouse pointer.  
False-colour spectrograms can be generated using the QUT Ecoacoustics Audio Analysis Program:
